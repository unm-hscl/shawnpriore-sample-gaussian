## Examples
### Comparison With Sample Based Approaches
We use a 6d CWH system with additive Gaussian noise with unknown mean and covariance to model the dynamics of a satellite rendezvous operation. This example compares the efficiency of the proposed approach with other sampling based methods.

### Comparison With Analytic Counterpart
We use a 6d CWH system with additive Gaussian noise with unknown mean and covariance to model the dynamics of a satellite rendezvous operation. This example compares the efficiency of the proposed approach with with the One-Sided Vysochanskij-Petunin inequality (the analytic counterpart to sample based concentration inequality derived in this work).
